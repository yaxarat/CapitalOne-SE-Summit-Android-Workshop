# Software Engineering Summit - Android Workshop
Welcome to the code repo for the Android workshop for Capital One’s Software Engineering Summit!

In this workshop, you will learn a basic Android app featuring a “login” screen which leads to an “account summary” screen which displays the user’s name and the recent transactions for one of their cards.

The resulting app will feature the following:
* A single activity app, with 2 fragments representing the 2 screens
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), the Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI
* Asynchronous programming using [Kotlin Coroutines﻿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTDXo0-SKuU)
* Local data storage for user credentials using [SharedPreference](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences)
* Real networking & JSON parsing for login using modern Android libraries

## Getting Started
- Open the `Start` project folder in Android Studio and run it either on a [physical device or emulator](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app).
- You can also open the  `Completed`  folder if you’d like to see project after we’re finished.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
